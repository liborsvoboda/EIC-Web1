Rapid is a modern web-based editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Rapid integrates advanced mapping tools, authoritative geospatial open data, and cutting-edge technology to empower mappers at all levels to get started quickly, making accurate and fresh edits to maps.

To learn about all the enhanced features Rapid provides, please check out our [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [training document](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/wiki#editing-in-rapid).
